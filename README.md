# Data-Science-with-RPi3
How I visualized data from Raspberry Pi 3: mostly using a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. Data visualization so far has included the use of matplotlib and plotly. Of course with prerequisites such as pandas, numpy and the Adafruit DHT library. Still working on improvements.
